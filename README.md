### Question 1 – Working with tax rates (if… else structure). 50%
The first question is taken from Chapter 3 page 212 Question 4 of your textbook. Please follow the
instructions and specifications in your textbook. The tax brackets there are reproduced below:

### Dependents Tax Rate
NO (zero) dependents 28%
1 to 3 dependents 25%
4 to 6 dependents 15%
More than 6 dependents 10%

For this question, you MUST use the if… else decision structure to accomplish your task. NO other
decision structure is acceptable. Zero marks assigned for non-compliance.

The web page will accept the following user INPUTs (with prompts) for an employee and your application
will calculate the weekly taxes deducted (withheld) for that employee for the current week.
i. The hourly pay rate for the employee;
ii. The number of hours worked by that employee for the current week;
iii. The number of dependents claimed by that employee.

Another web page will display the calculation details for the user to view and check.# Javascript_app

### User Interface
The main web page will have a title (“Employee Pay Calculator”) in big and bold font. Then in smaller
font, the same (main) web page will have a short statement about its purpose; “This web page will
calculate an employee’s weekly tax deduction. You will be asked for the employee’s hourly pay rate, the
number of hours worked by the employee for the current week and the number of dependents claimed by
that employee. Please click on the “Start” button when you are ready to begin.”

When the last piece of data is entered, another web page will show the pay details and the applicable tax
deduction so the user can verify the calculation.

You are allowed (in fact encouraged) to enhance this interface in any way IF it will…
a. Make the web page look “professional”
b. Make the work of the user more efficient
c. Reduce the possibility of mistakes in inputting data
d. Make understanding the report (output) more informative, easier and quicker to understand, and
more useful to the user (hint: adding colors randomly and a nice graphic does not help the user).


### Question 2 – Letter grade calculator (switch/case structure). 50%

The second question is NOT from the text book but it is straightforward. At the end of the term,
instructors at Douglas College must submit the final grades for all students in each class. Exams are
usually graded by awarding percentages e.g. 85% or 94%, etc. However, the grade reporting system at
Douglas only accepts letter grade entries e.g. A or B, etc. So, the instructor must make the transposition
“manually”. The percentage to letter grade transposition table the instructor uses is below. Please help
the instructor make the transposition with your JavaScript application.

### User Interface
The main web page will have a title (“Student Letter Grade Calculator”) in big and bold font. Then in
smaller font, the same (main) web page will have a short statement about its purpose; “This web page
will calculate a student’s letter grade and GPA. You will be asked for the student’s final grade expressed
as a percentage. Please click on the “Start” button when you are ready to begin.”

When the data is entered, another web page will show the letter grade and GPA so the user can verify the
calculation.
